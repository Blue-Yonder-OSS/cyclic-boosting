cyclic-boosting
===============

This package contains the implementation of the Machine Learning algorithm Cyclic Boosting, which is described in [Cyclic Boosting - an explainable supervised machine learning algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03425) and [Demand Forecasting of Individual Probability Density Functions with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07052).

Usage
-----

It can be used in a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)-like fashion. A usage example, including additional helper functionality, can be found [here](https://github.com/Blue-Yonder-OSS/cyclic-boosting-example).
