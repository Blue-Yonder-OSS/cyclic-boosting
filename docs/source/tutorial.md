# Tutorial

Cyclic Boosting can be used in a
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)-like fashion, combining a
binning method (e.g.,
[BinNumberTransformer](https://github.com/Blue-Yonder-OSS/cyclic-boosting/blob/main/cyclic_boosting/binning/bin_number_transformer.py))
with a Cyclic Boosting estimator (find all estimators in the
[init](https://github.com/Blue-Yonder-OSS/cyclic-boosting/blob/main/cyclic_boosting/__init__.py)).
Usage examples can be found in the
[integration tests](https://github.com/Blue-Yonder-OSS/cyclic-boosting/blob/main/tests/test_integration.py).

A more detailed example, including additional helper functionality, can be
found [here](https://github.com/Blue-Yonder-OSS/cyclic-boosting-example).
