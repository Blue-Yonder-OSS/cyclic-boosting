Cyclic Boosting Documentation
=============================

Cyclic Boosting is a **Python** library implementing the family of machine
learning algorithms of the same name, which is described in `Cyclic Boosting -
an explainable supervised machine learning algorithm
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03425>`_ and `Demand Forecasting of Individual
Probability Density Functions with Machine Learning
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07052>`_. It contains efficient, off-the-shelf,
general-purpose supervised machine learning methods for both regression and
classification tasks.
